# Netlify Functions configuration
# Note: Next.js automatically handles API routes as Netlify Functions
# If you need to configure function timeouts, do it per-function in the Netlify dashboard
# or use netlify.toml with [functions] (not [[functions]])

# Note: If secret scanning fails, you may need to disable it in Netlify Dashboard:
# Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment → Secret scanning
# Or clear build cache and redeploy
